    "The methodology proposed here to perform data re-sampling is based on heat release rate. The idea is to promote points with high HRR in the database, and penalize the presence of points with high density in the initial database along with low HRR. The methodology is adapted from the method proposed in the the paper of [Chi et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010218022003406). We note $|\\dot{q}|^n$ the min-max normalized norm of the absolute HRR. We consider two variables $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$ for which marginal PDFs will be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given sample $\\mathbf{x}$, the sampling PDF, conditioned on $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$, is written $f_s(\\mathbf{x})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A PDF for the HRR is then built by considering the distribution of HRR conditioned on $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$. The variable for which the PDF is built is a function of the HRR, $a=f(|\\dot{q}|^n)$. In the paper of Chi et al., the function $f(x)=1+\\alpha x$ is proposed as it helps to promote points in the flame region. In practice, we consider bins in $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$ space and then compute the averaged $a$ of particles in each bins. This gives us a PDF $f_q(\\mathbf{x})$. We propose to define the weighting function for the re-sampling as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_m(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{f_q(\\mathbf{x})}{f_s(\\mathbf{x})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$N_s$ samples are then drawn from the original points. Each sample $x$ is assigned the weight $f_m(\\mathbf{x})$ and a random selection is then performed. $N_s$ is defined by the user and should be carefully selected to (i) have enough point resolution in the dataset (reacting regions should be well populated); (ii) the distributions of variables must be better than the initial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "One shortcoming of the method happens when we want to predict ignition. Indeed, in the initial ignition phase, we have a relatively low number of points with low HRR. Therefore the method will tend to discard these points, which are crucial for predicting ignition correctly. The simple correction proposed here is to affect a large weight to points with progress variable $c<c_{0}$ (typically $c_{0}=0.1$ or $0.2$). This way, points with low progress variable will be selected into the database. In order to distinguish igniting from non-igniting points, a temperature condition is also added. \n",
