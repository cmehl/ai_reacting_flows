PAPERS
===========================

In this folder, you will find scripts to generate databases and train networks presented in articles using ARF. Each subfolder corresponds to a different article:  

- **PoF_2023**: [Mehl, C. and Aubagnac-Karkar, D., On-the-fly accuracy evaluation of artificial neural networks and hybrid methods to improve the robustness of neural network-accelerated chemistry solving, *Physics of Fluids* 35, 067115 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0151026) - *Note:* This work was conducted prior to the transition to PyTorch. The folder contains scripts to reproduce equivalent results in the new PyTorch-based environment.  

- **PROCI_2025**: Submitted as Conference paper for ECM2025. Code to be push on git soon.
